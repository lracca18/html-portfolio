<h1>The Best Movies I recently Watched</h1>
<h2>My top 3 in 2022/2024</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avatar: The way of the water</h3>
<p>The movie was amazing especially the animations/CGI </p>
<h3>Anyone but You</h3>
<p>The movie was very funny,<br />
but mostly it was because Sydney Sweeney was in it.</p>
<h3>The Monkey King</h3>
<p>It was a netflix original that I did not expect to like as much as I did <br />
I wish there was more character development but he's the monkey king <br />
so I didn't expect much</p>
